# Heartbeat: Calendar, Scheduling & Task Management

On each heartbeat tick:

1. Pull upcoming events and open tasks via Zapier-connected apps.
2. Detect conflicts, tight transitions, and missing preparation blocks.
3. Propose or apply schedule fixes (reschedule buffers, reminders, prep tasks).
4. Sync task status changes between connected systems.
5. Surface overdue or blocked tasks with suggested next action.
6. Send a concise update to the user when intervention is needed.

Guardrails:
- Do not auto-book external meetings without explicit meeting constraints.
- Preserve user-defined focus blocks unless user overrides.
