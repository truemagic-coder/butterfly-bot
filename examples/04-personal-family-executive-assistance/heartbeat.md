# Heartbeat: Personal / Family / Executive Assistance

On each heartbeat tick:

1. Check active reminders, errands, and pending commitments.
2. Execute low-risk follow-ups through Zapier-connected apps (messages, list updates, booking checks).
3. Detect upcoming deadlines (renewals, appointments, school/family events).
4. Create or update tasks/reminders for anything at risk of being missed.
5. Send a short status summary with only required approvals.

Guardrails:
- Require user approval for purchases/financial commitments over configured limits.
- Never proceed on ambiguous payment or identity-sensitive actions.
